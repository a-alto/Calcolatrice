# Simple JavaScript calculator

This is a very basic calculator i wrote in JS when I was 13 yo.  
It's a part of some experiments I made when I was trying to learn programming for the first time (self-taught).

You can find the original code in `Calcolatrice by Andrea Altomare.htm` file.  
`CalculatorScript.js` was recently created to highlight just the main part of the Calculator.
